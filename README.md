## Overview

Coco Motors is a demonstration project designed to highlight Angular's modern control flow syntax while providing a functional vehicle shopping cart experience. The application allows users to browse vehicles, view details, add items to a cart, and calculate totals, all while leveraging Angular's `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch` directives for clean and performant template logic.

### Why Coco Motors?

This project simplifies the development of dynamic UI components by using Angular's control flow syntax, which offers better performance and readability compared to legacy directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`. Key highlights include:

- üöó Vehicle Management: Browse and view detailed vehicle information, including name, classification, price, crew, passengers, and cargo capacity.
- üõí Shopping Cart: Add vehicles to a cart, update quantities, and calculate subtotals, delivery fees, taxes, and total prices.
- üé® Modern UI: Styled with Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS, featuring animations for a polished user experience.
- Control Flow Syntax: Demonstrates Angular's modern `@if`, `@for`, and `@switch` for declarative template logic.
- üõ†Ô∏è Testing: Comprehensive unit tests using Jest to ensure reliability.
- üì± Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a branded image and developer credits with animations.
- **Vehicle List**: Lists vehicles with a clickable selection, using `@for` for iteration.
- **Vehicle Detail**: Shows detailed vehicle information with a filmography list, leveraging `@if` for conditional rendering.
- **Cart**: Manages cart items with quantity selection and removal, using `@if` and `@for` for dynamic rendering.
- **Cart Total**: Calculates and displays subtotals, delivery fees, taxes, and totals, with conditional logic via `@if`.
- **Navigation**: Responsive navbar with cart count badge, using `@if` for conditional badge display.
